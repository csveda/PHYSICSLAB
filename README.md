# PHYSICSLAB
LABS FOR DR MILLER PHYSICS CLASS (PHYSIC C MECHANICS AND E&amp;M)

# DONT BE STUPID!!! DONT COPY THIS!!! THAT IS STUPID!!! PLEASE, FOR YOUR SAKE!! DO NOT COPY THESE LABS. YOU ARE WELCOME TO LOOK AT THEM. AND I DONT REALLY CARE IF YOU TAKE ANYTHING FROM THEM. BUT DONT BE STUPID AND TURN THIS IN FOR A PHYSICS CLASS. THAT WOULD BE SOOOO STUPID!!!1! ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE IN DR MILLERS PHYSIC's  CLASS!!  HE HAS ALREADY READ THESE LABS!!  IT WOULD TAKE HIM ABOUT 10 SECONDS TO NOTICE THAT I DID THESE!!! IF YOU DO TURN THEM IN, THEN I WILL TRACK YOU DOWN AND FIND YOU, THEN I WILL TELL YOU VERY CLEARLY AND LOUDLY THAT YOU ARE STUPID AND YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE DONE THAT!!!! I WILL SAY IT VERY LOUDLY AND EVERYONE WILL HEAR IT AND YOU AND THEY WILL THINK "OH MY GOSH THAT PERSON IS SO STUPID FOR TURING IN ANDY'S LAB" AND YOU WILL FEEL VERY BAD!

Also, note that these are not perfect, many of these labs were done quickly and in a rush. Generally, these labs did well but dont rely on them for getting a good grade. YOU VERY WELL MAY NOT!
